# Chromium-Single-Cell-Multiome-ATAC-to-Gene-Expression-prediction

Python notebooks created in response to "Open Problems - Multimodal Single-Cell Integration: Predict how DNA, RNA & protein measurements co-vary in single cells"

The main objective is not the predictions per se, but the creation of a series of functions to more effectively process large genomic datasets. This extends from data importing, to benchmarking across a nunber of machine learning algorthims, to creating a workflow for the training of neural networks.
